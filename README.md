Graph Color Palettes
====================

in graphs?

### Contrasting Color Palettes

One of the most common discrete color schemes for statstical plots is
that of R’s ggplot2 package. The standard palettes vary as the number of
variables increase, although the same low-hue version of red is common
to all. The first 16 color combinations are as follows:
