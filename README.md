Graph Color Palettes
====================

Are you looking for a highly contrasting color palette that works well
in graphs?

Here is a collection of color palettes that I like to use.

ggplot2 (R programming language)
--------------------------------

One of the most common triadic color schemes for statstical plots is the
base color palette from R’s ggplot2 package. The standard discrete color
palette for three colors produced through ggplot2 is the following:

\\begin{center} (\#F8766D, \#00BA38, \#619CFF) \\end{center}
